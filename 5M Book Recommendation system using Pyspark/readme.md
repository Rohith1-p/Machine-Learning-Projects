Book recommendation systems are essential for enhancing user experience by suggesting
relevant books based on individual preferences. This project develops a recommendation model using
machine learning, specifically collaborative filtering techniques. Implemented with PySpark and utilizing
AWS distributed computing for computation and Athena for querying the staging data, the system
leverages user-item interaction data and matrix factorization to predict ratings. The model achieved a
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.95, demonstrating its reliability in providing accurate book
suggestions.
