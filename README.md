## Real-World Problem Solving:  
The most important aspect of learning Machine Learning is understanding the problem and translating it into a machine learning solution. While many educational projects use large, pre-cleaned datasets that are ready for ML algorithms, real-world problem-solving requires a different approach. It involves:  
- Deeply understanding the problem context.  
- Collecting relevant data from available sources or creating the data if necessary.  
- Accurately interpreting the results in a real-world context.  

In domains such as healthcare, finance, and marketing, it is crucial not only to achieve good model performance but also to understand **how** the results are obtained. Knowing which features contribute to the outcome and how they influence the predictions is essential for making informed business decisions. This repository emphasizes not just building models but also understanding and explaining the results in a meaningful way.  

Feel free to explore the projects, learn from the insights, and enhance your Machine Learning skills!
